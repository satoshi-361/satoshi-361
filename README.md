# 👋 Hello! I am Satoshi-361.

## About me
I’m a DevOps engineer who accidentally ended up in application & user-experience design. 🤖🎨

## What I am working on now
<p>
    In 2014, I started a software development. After that, I have developed so many PHP, Javascript, C#, python, ruby projects using Laravel, Symfony, CakePHP, Vue, React, TypeScript and other frameworks.
    Nowadays I am involved in some Blockchain platform projects.
</p>

## My Main Skill
### 📕 Laravel, Symfony, Vue, React, TypeScript
[![Ultimate Guide to Building APIs & SPAs](https://github.com/satoshi-361/satoshi-361/img/book.png)](https://serversideup.net/ultimate-guide-to-building-apis-and-spas-with-laravel-and-vuejs/)

I have lots of team work experience and mainly participated Laravel, Vue, and TypeScript projects.

We were able to figure out a way to:
* Build a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) JSON API
* Create a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) web front-end
* Generate iOS and Android Apps with [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com/)
* **All from the same codebase 😱**
